A few simple Python scripts to experiment with Microsoft Azure SDK for Python


# Steps Taken
- Create Azure (Free Tier) Account
- Set up a Global Admin User (i.e. Added as Owner to a subscription)
- Logged in as the GAU and changed initial default password

## In Visual Studio Code:
- Installed Azure Tool plugin
- Logged into Azure Tools Plugin as GAUser
- Created a Python Script to import some Azure SDK Libraries and execute code using them

## In Command Line Tool (Cmder, GitBash, Powershell, CloudShell, etc.)
- Create a Python Virtual Environment
- Activate our Virtual Env
- Upgrade pip in your Python Venv: py -m pip install --upgrade pip   # this is optional but good practice
- We installed the required dependencies using Pip and requirements.txt

## Finally
- We executed our python code to interact with Azure via the SDK libraries
